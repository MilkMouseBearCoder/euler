# Project Euler Solutions

These are the solution I have so far for Project Euler http://projecteuler.net

#### Why so many languages?
I started using python since I had some free time on my hands and really wanted to learn a bit more python. Then I had to do some C++ and Delphi for university and used Project Euler problems as a place to get used to the language syntax before exams.

#### Disclaimer
I am paid as a Java developer, although I have worked in C++ and Delphi in the past, that was more than a decade ago and I do not have any python code in production.

Some solutions are better than others :)
